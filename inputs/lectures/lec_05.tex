\begin{refproof}{lm:top-homology-of-manifold-relative-to-cocompact-subset}
  \begin{claim}
    If the statement is true for $K_1$, $K_2\subset M$ and their
    intersection $K_1\cap K_2$,
    then the statement also holds for $K_1\cup K_2$.
  \end{claim}
  \begin{proof}
    Since $M$ is Hausdorff, the complements  $M \setminus K_i$ are open
    and we get an induced Mayer-Vietoris sequence
  \end{proof}
\end{refproof}
