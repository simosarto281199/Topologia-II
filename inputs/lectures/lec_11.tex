\section{Manifolds with boundary}

\begin{notation}
  Let us denote
  $\mathbb{R}^d_{+} \coloneqq \mathbb{R}^{d-1} \times \mathbb{R}_{\geq 0}$.
\end{notation}

\begin{definition}[Manifold with boundary]
  A $d$-dimensional \vocab{manifold with boundary}
  is a second countable, Hausdorff space that
  is locally homeomorphic to $\mathbb{R}^d_{+}$.

  That is, each point $x$ has a neighborhood
  $U$ homeomorphic to $\mathbb{R}^d_{+}$.

  The \vocab{boundary} $\partial M$ of such
  a manifold is the set of points
  mapped to the subspace
  $\mathbb{R}^{d-1} \times \set{ 0 } $ by any
  of the charts (or equivalently, all).
\end{definition}

\begin{example}
  The closed disk $D^d$ is a $d$-dimensional
  manifold with boundary.
\end{example}
\todo{$M \setminus B^d$}

\begin{remark}
  By glueing $M$ along its boundary with itself,
  we can view each manifold with boundary
  as a subspace of some manifold without boundary.
  That is, $M \cup _{\partial M} M$ is a manifold
  without boundary of the same dimension.
\end{remark}

\begin{example}*
  Considering again $D^n$, we note that
  $D^n \cup _{\partial D^n} D^n \cong S^n$.
\end{example}

\begin{remark}
  If $(M, \partial M)$ is a manifold $M$
  with boundary $\partial M$,
  we are interested in so-called \vocab{collars},
  that is, injective maps
  $\partial M \times [0,1) \hookrightarrow M$.

  Actually, for each manifold (with boundary),
  such a collar exists, although we will not
  prove this here.

  Note that we could also glue
  $\partial M \times [0,1]$ to $M$
  along $\partial M \times \set{ 1 } $
  (and $\partial M$).
  This gives us some manifold $\tilde{M}$ with
  boundary $\partial M$ that is homotopy
  equivalent to $M$ and has some obvious
  collar, which suffices for our needs.

  In any case, we will from now on assume that
  each manifold with boundary has a collar.
\end{remark}
